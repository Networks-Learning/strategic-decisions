# Scripts

The scripts **fico.sh**, **credit.sh** are used to perform the preprocessing steps on the *lending* and *credit* dataset respectively. Before execution, the unprocessed versions of the two datasets need to be downloaded from their respective sources and be placed in the directory [data/original](../data/original). Check the readme file in that directory for details.
